## 🚔 Overview
This is a 2D game written in Java. It is inspired by the original GTA game released in 1997.


## 🕹️ Game Features

2. 🔥 **Nitro**: Click R to get a nitro boost, which doubles the car's speed 
3. 🚨 **Gun Fight**: You will be in a constant "wanted" state where you have a shootout with a cop

5. 🥇 **High Scores**: Save and display high scores to see where you rank all time

## 🗂️ Source File Descriptions
* **Panel.java** - Panel logic and the game logic live here
* **Frame.java** - The Panel is instantiated within the contstructor for a JFrame
* **Main.java** - The JFrame is instantiated, therefore launching the game
* **Assets/Images** - Folder for PNG files used by the Java ImageIcon class to produce graphics.
  * The file naming pattern for player files is car + direction + regular vs nitro (e.g. "car_R_N"). This allows for 8 different images that correspond to the state of the car.
  * I used remove.bg to remove the PNG backgrounds for the files to give an icon effect on the panel
* **Assets/gta_high_scores.csv** - A local CSV where high scores are stored and read by the program
